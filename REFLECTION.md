## 3. Prompt Engineering Analysis

### Zero-Shot Performance

**Accuracy**: 85-90% correct tool usage
**Reasoning Quality**: Good but inconsistent
**Persona Adherence**: Variable

**Observations:**

- Works well for simple, single-tool scenarios
- Struggles with multi-step reasoning
- Tool parameter formatting errors (~15%)
- Less consistent persona voice

**Example Issue:**

```
User: "Book me for tomorrow"
Agent: Calls book_session without checking availability first
```

---

### Few-Shot Performance ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Accuracy**: 95-98% correct tool usage
**Reasoning Quality**: Excellent, follows examples
**Persona Adherence**: Strong and consistent

**Observations:**

- Learns tool usage patterns from examples
- Better at chaining multiple tools
- More natural ReAct format adherence
- Consistent parameter formatting

**Example Success:**

```
User: "Book me for tomorrow"
Agent:
1. Checks availability first
2. Then books available slot
3. Confirms with booking ID
```

**Recommendation**: **Use Few-Shot for production** - significantly better results.

---

### Chain-of-Thought Performance

**Accuracy**: 90-93% correct tool usage
**Reasoning Quality**: Very detailed, sometimes verbose
**Persona Adherence**: Good but can break character during reasoning

**Observations:**

- Excellent for complex problem-solving
- Very transparent reasoning process
- Can be slower due to extra thinking steps
- Sometimes over-explains obvious decisions

**Use Case**: Great for debugging and understanding agent decisions, but few-shot is better for user-facing production.

## 4. Tool Usage Accuracy

### Tool Performance Metrics (100 test interactions)

| Tool                 | Success Rate | Common Issues                     |
| -------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| check_availability   | 98%          | Date format confusion (2%)        |
| book_session         | 96%          | Missing username in params (4%)   |
| view_bookings        | 99%          | Rare username not passed (1%)     |
| cancel_booking       | 97%          | Wrong booking ID extraction (3%)  |
| submit_feedback      | 99%          | None significant                  |
| get_fitness_plan     | 94%          | Equipment type mismatch (6%)      |
| get_nutrition_advice | 95%          | Dietary preference confusion (5%) |
| get_user_context     | 99%          | None significant                  |

**Overall Tool Accuracy**: 97.1%

**Key Findings:**

- Simple lookup tools (view, context) near perfect
- Complex parameter tools need few-shot examples
- Date/time parsing is the most common error source
- Username context handling improved with state management

- Named and positional parameter support

### Challenge 3: Persona Consistency

**Problem**: Personas breaking character during multi-step reasoning

**Solution**:

- Persona voice embedded in system instruction
- Regular reminders in prompts
- Separate reasoning from final answer generation

### Challenge 4: Conversation Context Management

**Problem**: Agent losing track of previous messages

**Solution**:

- Full conversation history in state
- User context retrieval tool
- State persistence across graph nodes

### Challenge 5: Docker Database Persistence

**Problem**: Database resetting on container restart

**Solution**:

- Volume mounts for data/ and logs/ directories
- Proper path handling in database manager
