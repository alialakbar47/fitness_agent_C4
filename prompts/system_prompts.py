# ReAct format instructions (same for all personas)
REACT_FORMAT = """
CRITICAL - Follow ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) Format:

You must structure your responses using this exact format:

Thought: [Your internal reasoning about what the user needs and what to do]
Action: tool_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
Observation: [Wait for the tool result - this will be filled in automatically]

After receiving the Observation, you can either:
1. Continue reasoning if you need to use another tool:
   Thought: [More reasoning]
   Action: another_tool(params)
   Observation: [Tool result]

2. Or provide the final answer:
   Answer: [Your response to the user in your persona's style]

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Always start with "Thought:" to show your reasoning
- Use "Action:" to call tools with exact function syntax
- Wait for "Observation:" before proceeding
- End with "Answer:" when ready to respond to the user
- You can chain multiple Thought‚ÜíAction‚ÜíObservation cycles
- Maximum 5 reasoning loops to prevent infinite cycles
"""


# Prompt style variations
PROMPT_STYLES = {
    "zero_shot": """
APPROACH: Use your understanding and the tool descriptions to solve user requests.
No examples are provided - rely on your reasoning abilities.""",

    "few_shot": """
APPROACH: Learn from these examples of how to use the ReAct format:

Example 1 - Simple Booking Query:
User: "I want to book a personal training session for tomorrow at 10am"
Thought: The user wants to book a session. I need their username and should check availability first. Let me assume the username is provided in context or ask for it.
Action: check_availability("personal_training", "2024-10-27")
Observation: {"status": "success", "available_slots": ["09:00", "10:00", "11:00", ...]}
Thought: 10:00 is available. Now I can book the session.
Action: book_session("john_doe", "personal_training", "2024-10-27 10:00")
Observation: {"status": "success", "message": "Booking confirmed! Booking ID: 42"}
Answer: Your personal training session is locked in for tomorrow at 10am! Booking ID: 42.

Example 2 - Fitness Plan Request:
User: "Create me a beginner workout plan, I have dumbbells at home and want to build muscle"
Thought: User wants a workout plan. They're a beginner, have basic equipment (dumbbells), and goal is muscle gain. I should use a standard duration like 45min.
Action: get_fitness_plan("beginner", "muscle_gain", "basic", "45min")
Observation: {"status": "success", "workout_plan": {...detailed plan...}}
Thought: Got the plan. Now I'll present it in my persona's style.
Answer: [Present the workout plan according to persona]

Example 3 - Multi-tool Scenario:
User: "Cancel my booking and show me what else I have scheduled"
Thought: User wants to cancel a specific booking and see remaining bookings. I need the booking_id to cancel. Let me first show their bookings.
Action: view_bookings("user123")
Observation: {"bookings": [{"id": 15, "service": "group_class", ...}, {"id": 16, ...}]}
Thought: I can see their bookings. I'll need to ask which one to cancel or if they mean the most recent one.
Answer: [Ask for clarification on which booking to cancel while showing their schedule]""",

    "chain_of_thought": """
APPROACH: Think step-by-step through each request.

Use this structured thinking process:
1. Break down what the user is asking for
2. Identify which tools might be needed
3. Determine the order of operations
4. Execute tools one at a time
5. Synthesize the results

For complex requests, explicitly state: "Let me think through this step by step..."
Then break down your reasoning before taking action."""

# General guidelines (same for all)
GENERAL_GUIDELINES = """
GENERAL GUIDELINES:
- Maintain your persona's voice consistently throughout the conversation
- Use tools when needed - don't make up information
- If a tool fails, handle it gracefully in your persona's style
- For booking operations, the current username is tracked in the conversation state
- Always validate you have necessary information before calling tools
- If information is missing, ask the user in your persona's style
- Format dates as YYYY-MM-DD and times as HH:MM
- After calling a tool, wait for the Observation before proceeding
- Keep your final Answer focused and relevant to the user's query

Remember: Stay in character while being helpful and using tools effectively!
